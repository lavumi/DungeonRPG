## 2. Demo
As a tour of Ariadne 3D Dungeon Maker, there is a demo scene.
The scene file is placed on [Ariadne/Demo] folder.

In the dungeon, you can control the player 
by using arrow keys to move and using a space key to deciding. 

You can also control by using buttons on the screen. 
Those buttons correspond to controlling on mobile devices.


## 3. Workflow
First, create a map data by using MapEditor.
You can open the MapEditor from [Window/MapEditor] 
in the menu bar.

On the MapEditor, you can set attributes of the map 
by using draw tools.
To add an event, select a position using 
select tool and press [Open Event Editor] button.

On the EventEditor, you can define contents of events 
and starting conditions.

Second, after saving the map data, 
create a dungeon data from 
[Asset/Create/Ariadne/DungeonData] in the menu bar.
The dungeon data is a holder of map data. 
Set map data that you created to dungeon data.

Next, set the dungeon data to GameController object in the Scene. 
The GameController object has a component named DungeonSettings, 
so set the dungeon data to this component.

Required objects are placed in [Ariadne/Resources/Prefabs/SceneObjects] folder 
and [Ariadne/Resources/Prefabs/SceneObjects/CanvasParts] folder as prefabs.
When you intend to create a new scene, 
it is useful to duplicate demo scene and customize it.

Finally, ready to explore your dungeon. Execute the game!
